# Fivem-WarnScript
Hello this is my first release of my warn script that ive made, it comes with a sql that logs the warns in a database! For more info go to readme.md

Steps to get this script working...

1. First go to [server.lua] and put your discord webhook at the top.
2. Second Import the sql
3. Third download [MySQL-Async](https://github.com/brouznouf/fivem-mysql-async) and put that in your server
4. Fourth Setup [Warn.Use] with your ace perms or identifiers.

And you are good enjoy!!
